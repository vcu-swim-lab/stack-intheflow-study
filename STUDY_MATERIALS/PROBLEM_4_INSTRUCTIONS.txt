Problem 4 - Back Button Bugfix

- Users can create and save notes on the create-note screen. If the user has started
creating a new note, when the Android back button is pressed, all of their work is
lost. Users have complained that they want the app to save their progress, even if
they don't explicitly press the 'save' button.

- Help improve the app by making the Android back button save the note as if the user
had pressed the 'save' button. However, don't save the note if the user has not entered
any text yet (they probably didn't intend to save an empty note).
