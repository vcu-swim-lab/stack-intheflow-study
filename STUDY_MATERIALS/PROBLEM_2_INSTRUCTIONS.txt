Problem 2 - Splash Screen Enhancement

- Currently, there is no splash screen. Not only are we missing out on a chance for branding, but
there is a slight lag when the user opens the app due to server connection latency.

- Help improve the user experience by creating a splash screen that displays when the user starts
the app. It should help hide the latency between the app and the server.
