Problem 3 - Saved Password Bugfix

- On the settings page, there is a password field for users to log in to their Next-Cloud
account. This text field has the option to “unhide/hide” the text. Because the
credentials(including the password) are saved by the app, when you surf back to the
settings page, you can “unhide” the saved password. This is a security issue.

- Help secure the user’s credentials by only allowing the “unhide/hide” option when it has
just been entered. Once the user leaves the settings page, the password field should be “locked”.
Of course, the user should be able to “unhide/hide” the password once they enter a new password.
